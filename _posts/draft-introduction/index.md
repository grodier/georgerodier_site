My name is George...

And that feels like the most boring way to start any given post. Let alone the first post of a new site. And since this is my space, let's go completely off the wall. Let's talk about something that seemingly has very little to do with an introduction. Let's talk about _writing_.

I used to hate writing in school. It was always some predetermined topic that followed some strict rubric. Not my style of writing. And at the same time it was somehow subjective. Yuck! No one should be graded that way (or at least that's what I used to think). Give me any logical fact based subject instead.

I never looked forward to any writing assignment. I would inevitably write once, fix any egregious errors, tidy up the spelling mistakes, and turn it in. And then I would cross my fingers that it was technically correct and that in turn would make it "good".

Now, unshackled by any bounds, I look back at that approach and laugh. I find that I now enjoy writing. It can be a freeing experience to just let words flow from your finger tips. I get to write whatever I want and in whatever manner I choose. And I guess that's as good a reason as any to have a space (this site) to write.

I've also found that I am a better writer than when I was in school. That's not to say I'm great at it. If I'm lucky that'll come with time, practice, editing (lots of editing), and repitition. However, when writing is something I choose to do, I'm invested, and thus do something I've never done in the past: iterate.

This post has been written and rewritten many times over both in my head and at the keyboard. I've made bulleted lists of interesting ideas, potential paragraphs, and multiple unrelated musings. I've juggled them around, deleted, modified, and iterated, iterated, iterated until I came up with the post that you're reading today.

And I think that word, iterate, is as good as any to start to introduce myself. I like to think that people are imperfect, but as a result I'm always learning and striving to be better. As such I'm not a finished product. Maybe it's a result of my software engineering background, but let's identify problems, ship, and continuously improve. Let's iterate.

At one point, I thought an introduction post would closely resemeble an about me page. But first posts are weird. At least to me. They come with a misguided expectation that you'll learn about me and/or my future plans for this blog/site/ect (whatever this space eventually becomes). You'll learn more about me through the words I write and the stories I tell than any list of facts. So I'll continue to write and iterate and I'm excited to see what this space will eventually become!

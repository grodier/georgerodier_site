- But what does it really depend on. The senior developers response will typically go something like this: "Well if you are doing this, I'd do that, but if you want to prioritize something else, I'd do this. So that's what it depends on". And that's where the "ah-ha" moment for me was. There usually is an answer, but either context was missing or there's an open question that needs to be answered first (and that )
